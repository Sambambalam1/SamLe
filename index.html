									<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>Hey my name is Sam Le and my nationality is Australian and my background culture is Vietnamese. I was born on the 6th of April 2001 in Melbourne, Victoria. At home, my main language spoken is Vietnamese otherwise my main spoken language is English. I currently study a Bachelors of Business (Supply Chain and Logistic Management) at RMIT and have completed my VCE studies at Keysborough College. In my spare time, I love to play sports whenever I get the chance too, and my favourite sports are Basketball (Play as a Centre) and Volleyball. .</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>My interest in IT is technical support, where I help people with any technical issue that is needed. I enjoy getting to know the in-depth of technology and spread my knowledge to others and assist where I can. This interest sparked while I was in primary school where I was the only child and I had time on my hands to work with my broken hardware and play around with it. I would work on broken speakers, laptops and many other things and try to get them all to work. I succeeded and failed (even electrocuted) but I carried on and kept doing it. It grew more in-depth when I was in Year 8 when my parents told me they would buy my first computer. With the help of a family member, I was able to understand the inside and out of PC and became very interested in how everything worked. Over the years I researched more about PC’s and how they allow programs and things to work and then went on to upgrade them slowly.</p>
<p>When it came to choosing my university, I had many choices and to be honest, Monash was on top of my list just because of its reputation in the community and I thought it would be best, but as my ATAR was not high enough I couldn’t get in. I then chose RMIT but little did I know that RMIT has fantastic facilities for students and having been to Monash to study a few times in my spare time, I must say that RMIT’s facilities are way beyond Monash’s. I am glad that Monash didn’t accept me and got into a prestigious school such as RMIT..</p>
<p>Studying Supply Chain and Logistics Management was not my first preference as I did not know much about it. I studied the Bachelor of Information Systems in my first year of university and I didn’t like it at all so I decided to move into Logistics where I did some research and found out that I like the concept of it. I expect to have solid knowledge and a wide range of skills that I can bring into the industry once I complete the course. I also am studying IT as a minor and I hope these skills can help me with the constant evolution of technology and all its challenges.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>The Inventory Planner is in charge of ensuring that store plans/clusters, store size planning, and item flow strategies are properly planned and implemented. The Inventory Planner is in charge of accurately quantifying the buyer's product vision and Work with the supply chain to ensure that flow strategies can be implemented via logistical channels.  Inventory management can appear to be a lose-lose situation at times. Whether it's too much or too little, each scenario has a significant impact on a company's reputation, efficiency, and profitability. However, by aligning the necessary processes, technology, and, most crucially, people, you may achieve optimal fulfilment, forecasting, and inventory turn results. Inventory Planning struck my attention because of its need for proactive work as one of my previous managers in a factory I have worked at said I am a very proactive worker. Being able to make intuitive and also ration decisions is something I am very interested in and also working with technology to forecast data is something very exciting to me.</p>  
<p>There are a couple of different skills, qualifications and experiences that this job requires. Starting with skills and qualities, an inventory planner must have quantitative analytical skills; where they must understand how business maths and can turn those numbers into data that can be used. Clear communication, a key skill to inventory planning as being able to translate data into actionable information can be the key to success. Ownership, a huge factor to inventory as there is a lot of weight on your back as there is a lot of decisions coming from your information and if anything goes wrong, being able to admit it as we are only humans. Last but not least is a proactive attitude, where being proactive in a situation can make the difference to a positive and mediocre outcome. When it comes to inventory planning, qualification isn’t very necessary but it helps to have one as it gives a greater understanding of everything. People can be an inventory by working up the ranks with smaller companies and working their way up. As for the experience, a lot of job ads require 3-5 years of experience with demand forecasting and inventory management, while also requiring knowledge with certain supply and demands systems used within the workplace.</p>
<p>As for my skills, qualifications and experiences, I don’t have many that fit the job requirements but I’m working towards them. For skills, I have a great proactive mindset, am a quick learner, a positive attitude, great with numbers etc, and as for qualifications, currently, I have no real certificate of any sort. For experiences, I only have a couple from different jobs I’ve had, like teamwork and communication from working at Red Rooster, Warehouse experience from a pick and pack factory and manual labour work from being a fibreglass technician.</p> 
<p>Currently, with my skills and experiences, I will not be able to become an inventory planner but I want to be able to do it one day. I will start by letting go of my ego and becoming more honest and accepting of mistakes I make to be able to take ownership of any mistakes I make that affect the company, I will also try to pick up an internship or an entry-level supply chain job and try to get some experience in the field</p>
