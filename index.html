									<h2>Team Profile</h2>
                                    <h3>Team Name</h3>
                                    <p>Team Name: Genesis</p>
									<p>The reason behind the name of the team being ‘Genesis,’ is that Genesis is often the word used to ascribe the ‘origin or mode of formation of something,’ essentially meaning that when consumers have found our company (typically through the use of our products, I would imagine), they have literally found the origin, the ‘genesis’ to it. However, it also takes on an alternate meaning. In the bible, Genesis chapter 11, there is the Tower of Babel, which was how Christianity explained the differing languages. The shortest and rather oversimplified version of the story is that, decades after the great flood, humanity attempted to build a tower so that they could reach heaven. God, annoyed at the antics of humanity, struck the tower down, and scattered humanity across the world (thus making different cultures), and cofounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, explaining the creation of languages. I think, considering the overall nature of our first project, it seemed a perfect fit for the name of our company; it can’t be ‘Babel’ because by limiting us to specifically languages then that would prevent us as a group pursuing any further in different areas, as well as bable being the origination of the word ‘babble,’ which translated means ‘to talk,’ so not much of an interesting origin to be found there either.</p>
                                    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Name:Chenxing Zhou</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Student Number</strong>: s3813193</p>
                                    <p><strong>Ideal Job</strong>:Big data engineer.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Background</strong>:I was born in Zhejiang, China. I live with both my parents, and I have an older brother who is 7 years older than I am. I graduated from my high school in China during 2019, and studied at RMIT Foundation Studies in 2020. Now I am more than halfway through my first year of studying in order to gain a Bachelor of Information Technology, and I am excited to work with my team.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>:I like traveling very much, but due to COVID-19, the pandemic has required that I stay at home, so I don’t get to travel that often anymore. However, as a result of being forced to stay at home, I have started to like games, (DOTA2, csgo and Genshin), and I find it be an overall relaxing experience to help unwind stress. During my time, I also watch lots of anime (namely One Piece), and I will not refuse the opportunity to take a short trip.</p>
                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>:I am interested in cyber security and artificial intelligence in the IT field, and these interests come from two movies I have watched, namely ‘The Matrix,’ and ‘The Terminator.’ My brother also helped cultivate my interest in IT. He graduated from Monash University and managed to finally get a Bachelor of IT. It was always cool thing for me, who was in junior high school at the time, to watch him write code that I couldn’t understand, and it was because of this curiosity that helped grow my own interest in gaining a Bachelor of Information Technology. IT also has very good employment prospects in China, which means that after I graduate, I won’t need to worry about lack of employment. The scope of IT learning is very wide, which means that I can choose my favorite course, which is much better than some compulsory courses that I am not interested in, and has the support of my family members, who all wish me the best of luck on getting my degree.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Name: Fei ‘Phillip’ Mo</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Student Number</strong>: s3754501</p>
                                    <p><strong>Ideal Job</strong>:IT Engineer</p>
                                    <p><strong>Background</strong>:I am a year one student in RMIT, as well as a foundation student. As you may know, I am an international student. I am from China, and as such, my mother tongue is Chinese, but, I can also speak English, Mandarin and Cantonese. However, before I attended RMIT, I attended the Plympton International College in Adelaide, as my high school. I gave up my last year of high school and came to RMIT because I like the overall learning atmosphere and the general, friendly campus of RMIT.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>:My primary hobbies consist of playing Basketball and Fencing. But, I am also frequently enjoy playing video game games as well, and I’ve played a lot of different genres of game, mainly consisting of MMOs (Massively Multiplayer Online), and RPGs (Role Playing Games). such examples being Monster Hunter, and Dark Souls, as well as PUBG (Player Unknown Battlegrounds), and CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offense).</p>
                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>:My interest in IT started as far back as my childhood, as my parents worked in a computer market. When I was a kid, I always pulled the computers apart and try to put them together again… However, I was never able to put them back correctly. As I said earlier, I also play video games in my free time, and one day, my uncle, completely changed my life. He is a Java programmer who works in the gaming industry. He was always typing code with me, And he’s a SUPER big fan of World of Warcraft (WOW). As a result, I loved to play games.
Last semester, I applied Programming Tech and Intro to Program to learn Java and Python. However, I haven’t touched any program project yet. So, I hope I can have a clear purpose in this course. As you may know, I was a foundation student in RMIT. However, I could use my ATAR to come to RMIT because I attended my high school in Plympton International College in Adelaide. But I gave up my high school and came to RMIT to be a foundation student. I believe I can achieve my goals here at RMIT, and I have the upmost faith in my colleagues.</p>

                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>: I’ve always been very interested in artificial intelligence and networking. I first became interested in network when I was in primary school, because often while gaming, I would encounter the all-powerful, all-knowing ‘hackers.’ Additionally, my own interest in artificial intelligence was because of my uncle, who first introduced the concept to me. His job is relating to IT and tells me that one day AI will be very popular. Because I got an offer of foundation from RMIT University and graduated. I hope I can learn some practical knowledge to help in my future endeavors.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Name: Sam Le </strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Student Number</strong>: S3779946</p>
                                    <p><strong>Ideal Job</strong>: Inventory Planner</p>
                                    <p><strong>Background</strong>: My name is Sam Le and my nationality is Australian, while my background culture is Vietnamese. I was born on the 6th of April 2001 in Melbourne, Victoria. At home, my main language spoken is Vietnamese otherwise my main spoken language is English. I currently study a Bachelors of Business (Supply Chain and Logistic Management) at RMIT and have completed my VCE studies at Keysborough College.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>: In my spare time, I love to play sports whenever I get the chance too, and my favourite sports are Basketball (Play as a Centre) and Volleyball. </p>
                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>: My interest in IT is technical support, where I help people with any technical issue that is needed. I enjoy getting to know the in-depth of technology and spread my knowledge to others and assist where I can. This interest sparked while I was in primary school where I was the only child and I had time on my hands to work with my broken hardware and play around with it. I would work on broken speakers, laptops and many other things and try to get them all to work. I succeeded and failed (even electrocuted at points), but I carried on and kept trying. It grew more in-depth when I was in year 8 when my parents told me they would buy my first computer. With the help of a knowledgeable family member, I was able to understand the inside and out of Personal Computers and became very interested in how everything worked. Over the years I researched more regarding PC’s and how they allow programs and things to work and then went on to upgrade them slowly. Hopefully, RMIT lets me learn how to further my own skills.</p>

</p>
                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>: The area I am interested in is web design. As my best friend when I was young, I became interested in IT and programming after learning C++. The reason I chose RMIT is because I wanted to live in Melbourne and learn English perfectly. So, I chose RMIT, where I can English and the IT field that I am interested in. While studying, I want to learn web design.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Ideal Job</strong>: ICT Infrastructure Engineer</p>
                                    <p><strong>Background</strong>:  I was born in London, England, and moved to Geelong in Australia almost a year exactly after I was born and come from an Australian + Irish family. I studied at St. Joseph’s Geelong before attending MIT, during which I transferred to RMIT because I felt I could not pursue my dreams under their tutelage. I also have a black Labrador named Uzi!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>: Video games, mainly those that are either competitive, story-focused, or puzzle-based. Otherwise, to be honest, I don’t have many hobbies, beyond writing and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
                                    <p><strong>IT Interest/It Experience</strong>: Well, like most people who seem to come out of high school nowadays, my interest in IT mainly was sparked because of, unsurprisingly, video games! Of course, in time, my interest only increased as our world seems more and more digitally dependent with each passing year. I really like the ideas of using software to overcome problems, even if they’re minor. I view coding something, specifically something with a ‘goal’ in mind, to be a puzzle, and the code necessary, the steps and programming required to all be a part of the puzzle to find a solution. It’s enjoyable to me to find creative solutions to problems, and a software engineer is my way of doing that. My IT experience, however, is unfortunately quite small due to the limited teaching I had at my secondary school, but otherwise, I’ve done 5 years’ worth of IT subjects.</p>

                                    <h3>Difference between jobs</h3>
                                    <p>Surprisingly, or perhaps, unsurprisingly, given how we all have similar upbringings, there is actually very little difference between the jobs we want to do. All of us want to work in a team, where we can focus on utilizing our programming/general software skills. However, there are some key differences, specifically in the environments. where we want to work. For example, Sam wants to work as an inventory planner, but still uses software to help process and work with the supply chains to make sure everyone’s desire is met. Overall, while under different context, still applying those same skills and works as part of a team. Chenxing as a data engineer is responsible for finding trends in data sets, and narrows down the data to make it more efficient and understandable to their superiors and work colleagues so they can plan according, but still, like Sam, uses technical skills  to apply to their algorithms to their work, just like Sam applies algorithms to help manage his supply chain. Zelong’s also very similar, as specifically a technical operator, he has to focus on keeping processes up and running, the equivalent of a mechanic, with a bit more overall versatility and requirements, including responsibility for upkeep of their devices, as well as new additions they may consider improvements, still in a team-oriented environment, however, as they mainly work with others as a team to get the large amount of work easily organized between them. Chey’s job as well is quite similar as well. As a ICT Infrastructure engineer, he still has to work in a team environment, and has to apply technical skills to design, build, manage, and support the infrastructure service they provide. Fei’s appears to be the biggest outlier, whereas he holds the same general responsibility of everyone else (as listed under Chey; designing, building, managing, and supporting), their job as an IT engineer, depending on the placement, can either have them being the sole engineer in their environment, or part of a greater team. Huijoon is also very similar, because, despite working in a veterinary environment, he also works as part of a team, and utilizes web design to perform similar traits to everyone else in the group.
The main differences between the individual occupations is the environment, but otherwise, they’re actually rather similar; design something to help the company, ‘build’ it (in some contexts, this is just design but with extra steps), managing your team and those underneath you, as well as resources, data, etc., and supporting your company through your efforts and developments. </p>

                                    <h2>Difference between Quiz Results</h2>
                                    <h3>16 Personalities</h3>
                                    <p>Chenxing: Campaigner</p>
                                    <p>Chey: Virtuso</p>
                                    <p>Fei: Debater</p>
                                    <p>Huijoon: Diplomat</p>
                                    <p>Sam: Entertainer</p>
                                    <p>Zelong: Diplomat</p>
                                    <p>First, lets compare the results of the tests we shared.
For the 16 personalities quiz, the results all vary and show a lot of differences in terms of personality. A main example is how some of us are listed as more inclined to think logically over feelings, but for some it’s the other way around. However, in a tea environment, this is exactly what you want. You want, in a team, a large variety of people, because your team mates may pick up on something you simply don’t because of your personality type. The main difference is whether they’re extroverted or introverted, with a few smaller differences elsewhere.</p>

                                    <h3>Learning Style</h3>
                                    <p>Chenxing: Due to a communication error, they did a different type of online learning then the one intended, instead doing a test that instead is meant to show how well you’ve adapted to online classes.</p>
                                    <p>Chey: Visual/Tactile</p>
                                    <p>Fei: Visual</p>
                                    <p>Huijoon: Social</p>
                                    <p>Sam: Auditory</p>
                                    <p>Zelong: N/A</p>
                                    <p>Learning Style, in a group environment, is best used for when research, and showing others the results of the research, you have gained. For example, Chey is a visual/tactile, so the best way they understand something is by seeing something, or by applying it in practice as they learn, and the best way to show him the efforts of the research gained, is through a visual manner (for example, text, rather then a conversation). Fei is very similar, as they are visual, and Sam is auditory, which means they, unlike the other two, learn and understand best, when they are directly spoken to.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h3>Additional Quiz</h3>
                                    <p>Chenxing: 56 on a creativity test – ‘work in progress’</p>
                                    <p>Chey: IQ Test - 118</p>
                                    <p>Fei: Psychomoetric Test</p>
                                    <p>Huijoon: 105</p>
                                    <p>Sam: IQ between 105 and 120</p>
                                    <p>Zelong: 105</p>
                                    <p>With the exception of talking about Chey and Sam’s IQ test (while, obviously it’s important to have a high iq, it rarely comes into play in a team environment), Chenxing and Fei’s tests show that they’re quite good when it comes to team environments. Chenxings’ creativity test is something important in a team environment, especially when it comes to planning, and preparation of the idea, and he was very close to getting the highest amount possible that he could. Feis’ shows that he is very calm and logical even when facing difficulty, or under stress, which is a very important quality to have in a team, as, obviously, when it comes to a computer programming, when it doesn’t work it can become rather stressful, which can lead to mistakes, so it’s important that we should try to avoid that from happening altogether.</p>
